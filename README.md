## Using the Dummy Data

This repository contains dummy data for testing and querying purposes. The data is organized into three JSON files located in the `data` directory:

- `users.json`: Contains dummy user data including fields such as `id`, `name`, `email`, and `role`.
- `products.json`: Contains dummy product data including fields such as `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, and `available`.
- `orders.json`: Contains dummy order data including fields such as `id`, `productId`, `quantity`, `userId`, and `date`.

You can use this data to test your applications or for querying exercises.
